    "In this chapter, we will work our way through a concise review of the Python functionality we have covered so far. Throughout this chapter, we will work with a interesting, yet not too large dataset, namely the well-known *Arabian nights*. *Alf Laylah Wa Laylah*, *the Stories of One Thousand and One Nights* is a collection of folk tales, collected over many centuries by various authors, translators, and scholars across West, Central and South Asia and North Africa. It forms a huge narrative wheel with an overarching plot, created by the frame story of Shahrazad.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The stories begin with the tale of king Shahryar and his brother, who, having both been deceived by their respective Sultanas, leave their kingdom, only to return when they have found someone who — in their view — was wronged even more. On their journey the two brothers encounter a huge jinn who carries a glass box containing a beautiful young woman. The two brothers hide as quickly as they can in a tree. The jinn lays his head on the girl’s lap and as soon as he is asleep, the girl demands the two kings to make love to her or else she will wake her ‘husband’. They reluctantly give in and the brothers soon discover that the girl has already betrayed the jinn ninety-eight times before. This exemplar of lust and treachery strengthens the Sultan’s opinion that all women are wicked and not to be trusted. \n",
    "\n",
    "> When king Shahryar returns home, his wrath against women has grown to an unprecedented level. To temper his anger, each night the king sleeps with a virgin only to execute her the next morning. In order to make an end to this cruelty and save womanhood from a \"virgin scarcity\", Sharazad offers herself as the next king’s bride. On the first night, Sharazad begins to tell the king a story, but she does not end it. The king’s curiosity to know how the story ends, prevents him from executing Shahrazad. The next night Shahrazad finishes her story, and begins a new one. The king, eager to know the ending of this tale as well, postpones her execution once more. Using this strategy for One Thousand and One Nights in a labyrinth of stories-within-stories-within-stories, Shahrazad attempts to gradually move the king’s cynical stance against women towards a politics of love and justice (see Marina Warner’s *Stranger Magic* (2013) in case you're interested).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first European version of the Nights was translated into French by Antoine Galland. Many translations (in different languages) followed, such as the (heavily criticized) English translation by Sir Richard Francis Burton entitled *The Book of the Thousand and a Night* (1885). This version is freely available from the Gutenberg project (see [here](http://www.gutenberg.org)), and will be the one we will explore here."

    "2. Each play has a cast list (`<castList>`), with a `role`-element for every character in it. In this element, the `civil`-attribute encodes the gender of the character (`M`/`F`, or another charatcer ). Create for each individual author a barplot using `matplotlib`, showing the percentage of male, female and 'other' characters as a percentage. Pick beautiful colors.\n",
    "3. **Difficult**: The information contained in the `castList` is priceless, because it allows us to determine for *each* word in the play by whom it is uttered, since the `<sp>` tag encodes which character in the cast list is speaking at a particular time. Parse play `156.xml` (*L'Amour à la mode*) and calculate which of the characters has the highest vocabulary richness: divide the number of unique words in the speaker's utterances by the total number of words (s)he utters. Only consider speakers that utter at least 1000 tokens in the play.\n",
