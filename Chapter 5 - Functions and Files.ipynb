Internally, a computer knows no characters whatsoever: every piece of information is represented as numbers (which in turn are represented in a binary format, as zeroes and ones). An encoding specifies which numbers represent which characters. A famous and long-standing encoding scheme is ASCII, in which for example the letter 'A' is encoded using the number 65. ASCII however only has a very limited alphabet and can not encode a lot of writing systems. A modern-day encoding supporting countless writing systems is *unicode* and *utf-8* is a kind of unicode. This the type of encoding that you will want to use for your data whenever possible. Whenever you have a choice, you should use unicode!"

In Sublime, for instance, you can first save your file with a \".py\" extension, and then 'build' your code by hitting Ctrl+b (Windows, Unix) or Command+b (Mac OS X). You will now see that the output of your script will be written to your screen in Sublime.\n",

In general, you should always watch out when you use a command line interface to your machine: only execute commands that you (more or less) understand!

To launch such an interpreter, just type in `python3` in your console and hit enter.
